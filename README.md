## Resource Class: Bicycles
For this project, I have selected **Bicycles** as the resource class. Each bicycle in the search results has the following attributes:
- `bicycle_type` (string) — The type of the bicycle (e.g., Mountain, Road, Hybrid).
- `wheel_size` (number) — The size of the bicycle's wheels (e.g., 27.5, 28, 26).
- `cost` (number) — The price of the bicycle (e.g., 250, 350, 200).
